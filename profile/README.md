# DAIR Center @ CMI

This is the GitHub organization for software products, tools, and services developed by the Center for Data Analytics, Innovation, and Rigor (DAIR) of the Child Mind Institute.

## Motivation
The scientific method requires that hypotheses be robustly tested so that they can be built upon. But in mental health research, there is a crisis of reproducibility. Sample sizes are frequently too small and measurements too imprecise. Different tools yield different results. And, all too often, one analytic approach suggests a different conclusion from another.

Treatments won’t improve if the science behind them can’t be trusted. That’s why we’re focused on advancing the methods used in brain research. We’re developing analytical tools that allow scientists to pool data for greater impact. And we’re building neuroimaging tools and processes that gain deeper insights into brain signals, consistently detect meaningful differences, and strengthen the science behind mental health treatments.
